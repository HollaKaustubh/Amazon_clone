# Amazon_clone
This project is a basic home page clone of Amazon.com, created as a part of my CSS and HTML learning journey. It serves as a demonstration of my understanding of front-end development using these technologies. Please note that this is a static demo page.

# Project Structure
    - index.html: The main HTML file representing the home page.
    - styles.css: The CSS file containing the styles for the page.
